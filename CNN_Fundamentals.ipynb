        "A digital image is composed of pixels, which are the smallest units of the image. Each pixel contains information about color and intensity.\n",
        "- In a grayscale image, each pixel is represented by a single value indicating the intensity of light (ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 is black and 255 is white).\n",
        "- In a color image, each pixel is represented by three values (e.g., RGB) corresponding to the intensity of red, green, and blue channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Differences:\n",
        "- Grayscale images have a single channel, while color images have three channels (RGB).\n",

        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data like images.\n",
        "- Role in image processing: CNNs automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n",
        "- Advantages over traditional neural networks:\n",
        "  - CNNs use convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies in images, which traditional neural networks cannot do efficiently.\n",
        "  - CNNs reduce the number of parameters through weight sharing and local connectivity, making them computationally efficient.\n",

        "- Convolutional layers are the core building blocks of CNNs. They apply a convolution operation to the input, which helps in extracting features like edges, textures, and patterns.\n",
        "- Filters (or kernels) are small matrices used in convolutional layers to detect specific features in the input. They are applied by sliding over the input image and computing the dot product between the filter and the input region.\n",
        "- Padding: Adding extra pixels around the input image to control the spatial size of the output. It can be \"valid\" (no padding) or \"same\" (padding to maintain the input size).\n",
        "- Strides: The step size with which the filter moves across the input. Larger strides reduce the output size, while smaller strides preserve more spatial information.\n",
        "- Impact on output size: The output size depends on the input size, filter size, padding, and strides. The formula is:\n",

        "- Max pooling: Selects the maximum value from a region of the feature map. It is more commonly used because it preserves the most prominent features.\n",
