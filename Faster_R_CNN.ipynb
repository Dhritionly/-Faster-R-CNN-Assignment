        "Faster R-CNN is a state-of-the-art object detection model that consists of the following components:\n",
        "- **Backbone Network (e.g., ResNet, VGG)**: Extracts feature maps from the input image.\n",
        "- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Generates region proposals (potential object bounding boxes) using anchor boxes.\n",
        "- **RoI Pooling Layer**: Extracts fixed-size feature maps from the region proposals for further processing.\n",
        "- **Classification and Regression Heads**: Predicts the class labels and refines the bounding box coordinates for each region proposal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of each component:\n",
        "- The backbone network processes the input image to produce feature maps.\n",
        "- The RPN identifies regions of interest (RoIs) that may contain objects.\n",
        "- The RoI Pooling layer ensures that the feature maps for each region proposal are of a consistent size.\n",

        "3. **Fast R-CNN Training**: The Fast R-CNN detector is trained to classify region proposals and refine their bounding box coordinates.\n",
        "4. **Joint Training**: The RPN and Fast R-CNN are trained together in an alternating fashion, where the RPN generates proposals, and the Fast R-CNN uses these proposals for detection. This joint training allows both components to improve simultaneously.\n",
